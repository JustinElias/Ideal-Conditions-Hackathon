# Ideal-Conditions-Hackathon
Helps predict if the weather conditions for the current day are good enough to start planting

## Research
This section is dedicated to research found while working on this Hackathon.

### Temperature Requirements
<ul>
  <li>Corn can survive brief temperatures from 32F to over 112F</li>
  <li>Optimal temperatures for growth vary between day and night</li>
  <li><strong>Optimal Daylight Temperature:</strong> 77F to 91F</li>
  <li><strong>Optimal Night Temperature:</strong> 62F to 74F
</ul>

### Weather Requirements
<ul>
  <li>Corn requires a soil temperature of 50F to germinate</li>
  <li>Planting into soil that is less than 50F will cause the seed to sit dormant. This results in:<ul>
    <li>Seed vulerabile to deseases</li>
    <li>Insects</li>
    <li>Animal Preditors</li>
    <li>Delayed Emergence</li>
    <li>Complete failure of emergence</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Sunny Weather:</strong> Ideal weather condition for planting corn</li>
  <li><strong>Cloudy Weather:</strong> Although not ideal for extended periods of times, it is still okay to plan corn on a cloudy day if soil conditions are good.</li>
  <li><strong>Rainy Weather:</strong> Not ideal and no planting should be done while it is raining.</li>
</ul>
